\policy{Respect in (and out of) the Classroom}{
I expect everyone to treat, and be treated, with respect in our classroom. Every one of us brings something new, interesting, and engaging to the topics that we will discuss. This does not mean you cannot disagree and express disagreements; however, we can all expect that each other does so with the respect we desire to be treated with ourselves.
}

\policy{Academic Integrity}{
You are expected to follow university guidelines regarding academic integrity on all assignments (graded or not). I expect that you will provide appropriate credit through citation and acknowledgement of others' ideas while you take this class. I am required to report all suspected violations of the university's code of conduct to the Dean and will do so when I suspect plagiarism or academic dishonesty.
