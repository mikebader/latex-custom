\subsection{Students with Disabilities, ASAC} American University
is committed to making learning and programming as accessible as
possible. Students who wish to request accommodations for a
disability, must notify me with a letter of approved
accommodations from the ASAC. As the process for registering and
requesting accommodations can take some time, and as
accommodations, if approved, are not retroactive, I strongly
encourage students to contact the ASAC as early as possible. For
more information about the process for registering and requesting
disability-related accommodations, contact ASAC.
